# WebDriver IO
---
WebDriver IO is an open-source testing utility for NodeJS. It makes it possible to write super easy selenium tests with JavaScript in your favorite BDD or TDD test framework. It basically sends requests to a Selenium server via the WebDriver Protocol and handles its response. These requests are wrapped in useful commands and can be used to test several aspects of your site in an automated way. 

In simple words – WebDriver IO is a custom implementation for selenium’s W3C web driver API. It is written in JavaScript and packaged into ‘npm’ and runs on Node.js.

---
There are three different projects:  
- gem-webdriver-io
- sample-webdriver-io-project
- webdriver-io-template

**1.** **Gem-WebDriver-IO :** It contains the web-actions methods and custom gem-report. This project works as a npm module. We are going to use this in other projects and utilize the its methods.

**2.** **Webdriver-IO-Template :** This is the basic starter template that you can clone and start writing your test and using the web-actions from gem-webdriver-io project. We are using page object model approach, creating different folders for locators, steps and features files.

**3.** **Sample-Webdriver-IO-Project :** This is the sample project you can clone it for reference.
