# WebDriver IO
---
WebDriver IO is an open-source testing utility for NodeJS. It makes it possible to write super easy selenium tests with JavaScript in your favorite BDD or TDD test framework. It basically sends requests to a Selenium server via the WebDriver Protocol and handles its response. These requests are wrapped in useful commands and can be used to test several aspects of your site in an automated way. 

In simple words – WebDriver IO is a custom implementation for selenium’s W3C web driver API. It is written in JavaScript and packaged into ‘npm’ and runs on Node.js.

### Why WebDriver IO
WebDriver IO is a flexible and powerful automation framework that can be used to automate web applications (WebDriver/Chrome Dev Tools), mobile (Hybrid/Native) applications using Appium, and even Native desktop applications (Windows and macOS), using a custom configuration of Appium (mobile automation).  
The tests performed on WebDriver IO are simple and concise. You can control browsers with just a few lines of code. As it is built in NodeJS, you can write your tests using JavaScript, as well as with TypeScript.  
NodeJS has a vast community around the world that has helped the framework grow with new, powerful, and useful features and plugins to make suite tests much more robust, complete, and stable. Compared to many automation tools, WebDriver IO is a truly open-source project that is run with open governance and owned by a non-profit entity called Open-JS Foundation.  

### Why you should consider using WebDriver IO over Selenium WebDriver? 
- Front-end friendly
- Power of Selenium
- Easy to use
- Parallel Execution
- Cross Browser Testing
- Easy Project Setup

### Key Features of WebDriver IO
1. Beginners can easily understand the setup. 
2. It also supports built-in waits and retries. 
3. It needs an external library. 
4. JS users can easily understand the test created in it. 
5. User custom implementation. 

### Limitations of WebDriver IO
1. Debugging the test is difficult. 
2. It doesn’t have any paid features. 
3. It contains a lot of customizations which can lead to confusion. 
4. Async-await syntax can be confusing for beginners. 
5. CLI test runner only.

There are three different projects -
1. gem-webdriver-io
2. sample-webdriver-io-project
3. webdriver-io-template

**Gem-WebDriver-IO :** It contains the web-actions methods and custom gem-report. This project works as a npm module. We are going to use this in other projects and utilize the its methods.

**Webdriver-IO-Template :** This is the basic starter template that you can clone and start writing your test and using the web-actions from gem-webdriver-io project. We are using page object model approach, creating different folders for locators, steps and features files.

**Sample-Webdriver-IO-Project :** This is the sample project you can clone it for reference.

#### Install the Packages
``` bash
npm install
```

### Run the Test Cases
``` bash
npm test
```
